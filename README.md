🧭 Introduction

Cryptography is everywhere—your browser, your phone, your password manager, online banking, messaging apps, and even blockchain networks.
This repository teaches cryptography from first principles with a focus on:
clarity
practicality
modern algorithms
hands-on implementation examples

You do not need advanced math knowledge to follow this roadmap.

⭐ Why Learn Cryptography?

It helps you write secure applications
It improves your understanding of authentication and secure communication
It's essential in modern engineering: HTTPS, JWT, OAuth, blockchain, cloud security
It’s fun, deep, and intellectually rewarding

📚 Prerequisites

Basic understanding of:
Variables, loops, functions
Any programming language (C#, Python, Java, JavaScript, etc.)
Optional but helpful: discrete math basics (modular arithmetic)
